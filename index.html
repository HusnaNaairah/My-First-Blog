        <h2>The Most Breathtaking Sunset of My Life</h2>
        <article class="info">
            <p>After completing my engineering degree, my family and I embarked on a remarkable trip across Karnataka, visiting and spending quality time with all our relatives. We spent a couple of days in Hassan (a city in Karnataka) too. On June 3, 2023, a spontaneous decision led us to explore the scenic spots near Hassan.</p>

                <p class="img_name test">Haluvagilu Waterfall</p>
            </div>    

            <p class="p2" >
            We made our way to the Haluvagilu waterfall, known for its unique walkway positioned amidst the flowing water. When the river runs sufficiently, the walkway vanishes beneath the water's surface, creating the illusion that one is walking or standing directly on the water itself. Eager to capture this spectacle and share it on social media, I was disappointed to find that the summer had left the water level too low for the desired effect.</p>
            
            <p class="p3">Undeterred, my cousin then guided us to Shettyhalli Rosary Church, an abandoned structure that submerges during the monsoon season.You can find out more about its history by clicking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shettihalli_Rosary_Church" target="_blank">here</a>. As we approached, I realized it wasn't yet monsoon, and our expectations might again go unmet. Evening had fallen, and little did I know that the most beautiful sunset of my life awaited.</p>

            </div>
                    

            <p class="p4">Arriving at our destination, an open space greeted my eyes. I stepped out of the car and turned to witness a mesmerizing sunset, its warm hues reflecting off the car's surface. We explored the area, capturing moments near the remains of the church, not submerged due to the season. Though I missed capturing the sun itself, the church's majestic images lingered in my camera.</p>

            <p class="p5" >The atmosphere took on an eerie quality, resembling scenes from a horror movie, perfect for cinematic brilliance. As time passed, we enjoyed skipping stones on the water, the harmonious sound of stones creating ripples and the cool breeze.</p>
            <p class="p6" >As the day deepened into twilight, a beautiful orange sunset cast its reflection on the water. It felt surreal, like the picturesque scenes I had only seen on the internet. Along the banks of the Hemavati reservoir stood an abandoned jeep, seemingly placed with intention, as if awaiting its moment in a photo shoot or film scene. The entire setting was nothing short of an ideal spot for capturing the magic of the moment.</p>

            <p>Lost in the beauty of the moment, I found myself immersed in the scene unfolding before my eyes. The realization struck that to preserve this feeling, I needed to capture it in my camera. I shot videos and captured silhouettes of my family against the picturesque backdrop. The pinkish hue of the twilight sky added to the enchantment. These memories are etched in my heart, and I long for more experiences akin to that enchanting evening, where what began as an impromptu visit with low expectations blossomed into something exceptionally special. Forever grateful for the unexpected magic of that evening!</p>
